# Twitter Smart Contract

This project contains a smart contract named `Twitter` written in Solidity. The contract is designed to mimic a simplified version of the Twitter platform on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Tweet Creation**: Users can create tweets with a maximum length of 280 characters.
- **Tweet Retrieval**: Users can retrieve a specific tweet or all tweets associated with an address.

## Smart Contract Methods

### createTweet

Allows a user to create a new tweet.

**Parameters**:

- `string memory tweet`: The content of the tweet.

**Requirements**:

- The tweet must not exceed 280 characters.

### getTweet

Retrieves a specific tweet created by the caller.

**Parameters**:

- `uint256 i`: The index of the tweet in the user's tweet array.

**Returns**: `Tweet` struct containing the tweet details.

### getAllTweet

Retrieves all tweets associated with a given address.

**Parameters**:

- `address owner`: The address of the user whose tweets are to be retrieved.
